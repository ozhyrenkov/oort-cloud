# Oort cloud
> The Oort cloud, sometimes called the Öpik–Oort cloud is a theoretical concept of a cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals proposed to surround the Sun at distances ranging from 2,000 to 200,000 AU (0.03 to 3.2 light-years). Hypothetical and not scientifically proven source of long-periodic comets.

## Idea
Many analytical organisations with main focus on investigation and journalism wanted to have fully internal analogue of cloud tools in their intranet.

The *Oort cloud* is intended to be easy-to-go setup for this kind of tasks, main idea - that it is theoretically existing cloud which can produce physical results - cometes. In a world of journallism you may count this an invisible cloud which sometimes produce meaningful investigation and reports.

## Included services
- **Nextcloud** - ready to go own cloud drive for files with multi-users, folders and even text editor in Markdown style. Good replacement for Google Drive.
- **Aleph** - best open source tool ever created by [OCCRP](http://occrp.org) for analysis of unstructured and structured data with OCR, transliteration and scalable architecture.
- **Mediawiki** - self-hosted knowledge base in wikipedia style.

## Possible other services
- [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com) - selfhosted Notion-like system, possible replacement for Mediawiki.
- Jupyterhub server - for analytical work with focus on data analysis in python.
- [Redash](https://redash.io) - easy BI on multiple databases tool, allows to convert SQL queries into Dashboards.

## Next steps
- [x] One docker-compose version for all stacks.
- [x] No port conflicts between services.
- [ ] Reverse proxy in front of all services.
- [ ] Bash script to setup environment.
- [ ] Bash CLI to run Oort Cloud.
